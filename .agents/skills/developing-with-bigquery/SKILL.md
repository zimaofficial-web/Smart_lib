This skill provides comprehensive guidance for BigQuery services, optimizations,
and data handling. It acts as a routing table for specialized BigQuery topics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For general standards on running BigQuery in notebooks (SQL cells, `export`
> keyword), see `@skill:notebook-guidance`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> You MUST check the data size before deciding on which libraries to use. Use
> the data size to justify your decision.

Refer to the following resources for expert guidance on specific BigQuery
features:

### 1. Query Optimization

Performance and efficiency guidelines for BigQuery SQL. Includes rules for
column pruning, pushdown, and materialization strategies. - **Guide**:
[OPTIMIZATION.md](references/OPTIMIZATION.md)

### 2. BigFrames (BigQuery DataFrames)

Guidelines for generating valid BigFrames code for data manipulation, model
development, and visualization. - **Guide**:
[BIGFRAMES.md](references/BIGFRAMES.md)

Bigframes should be the default library/tool as it is more efficient than using
the BigQuery Python client library.

### 3. BigQuery ML & AI Functions (BQML SQL)

Usage rules and syntax standards for all BigQuery AI/ML functions via SQL
(Forecasting, Generative AI, Classification, etc.). - **Guide**:
[BQML.md](references/BQML.md) - **Functions Reference**: -
[AI.FORECAST](references/ai-forecast.md) -
[AI.EVALUATE](references/ai-evaluate.md) -
[AI.GENERATE_TABLE](references/ai-generate-table.md) -
[AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING](references/ai-generate-embedding.md) -
[Remote Models](references/remote-models.md)
[CONTRIBUTION_ANALYSIS](references/ml-contribution-analysis.md)
[VECTOR_SEARCH](references/vector-search.md)

### 4. Notebook SQL cells

Refer to `@skill:notebook-guidance` for standards on running BigQuery in
notebooks.
